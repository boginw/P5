# Initial problem statement
This section describes how the project group came to an agreement on an initial problem, which eventually would be narrowed down to the specific problem being solved in this project.

#### Shaping a common curiosity
Following the group formation, the group's immediate focus was to specify what sort of embedded system to work on during the semester - keeping in mind that the project, as specified by the curriculum[^AAU_Curriculum_SW5], must include some sort of machine intelligence, as this was the chosen elective course in this project group.

As a result from a brainstorming phase, several ideas where brought to the table, including:
- a proof-of-concept take on the cashier-less store Amazon Go [^Amazon_Go]
- a self-rocking crib responsive to infants crying
- an autonomous vehicle of some sort.
Following a conceptual expansion on all ideas, as well as a voting session, the latter was chosen as the general subject for this project.

This "rhythm" (brainstorm -> expand -> vote) was reused to narrow down the working-field. During the expansion, realism and motivation was kept in mind as well, as to not end up over-encumbering the group with a task either too complex or uninteresting. Following a vote, it was decided to look more into the speed at which an auto vehicle might travel.

#### Formulating a relevant initial problem statement
Statistics from DEMA (Denmark's Emergency Management Agency) show that 1748 traffic accidents where responded to in 2017 [^DEMA_statistics]. Violation of speed regulations might be a contributing factor in a part of these, which led to the following initial problem statement:
> What is the cost of increased speeds for the Danish society, in terms of economic and social perspectives
