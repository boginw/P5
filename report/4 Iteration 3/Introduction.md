# Activity Design
Having identified a set of activities in [@sec:MI_Overview], and presented actual solutions in [@sec:CandMI], the next section will present the tactics/algorithms chosen to complete the activities in this project. As mentioned in [@sec:CandMI], one of the papers utilized the OpenCV API. The group invested some time looking through the documentation, identified several useful algorithms, and decided to include OpenCV as part of this project.
