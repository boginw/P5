# Discussion
The following section will discuss the results presented in the report, along with the findings presented along the way.

## Neural network
For the project, an artificial neural network from the OpenCV Java library was chosen, as described in [@sec:somethingThatComesBeforeANN].
This implementation of the neural network only allowed for one activation function to be used in the entirety of the network.


We done okay, but we could have done it better.
If we had not chosen an artificial neural network, we would have had more sophisticated activation functions to choose from.

### OpenCV
Was OpenCV the right choice?

### Input
Was it best to take "20" or "2", i.e. both digits, or only one?

## Normalization
Was good, more please

### Flattening the circle
Is good

### Rotating number
We should have done this

### Obtaining everything but the last digit
Topographic tingeling

## Car
What changes should we have done

### Language
Choosing another language

### Steering
Make steering sophisticated, so it follows a line

### Using third-party software for embedded systems
Is bad when memory testing
