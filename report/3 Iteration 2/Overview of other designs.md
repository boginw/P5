## Overview of Other Designs

Instead of trying to invent a usable MI from scratch for this project, our first move was to do some research on how others have tackled the problem regarding recognizing speed encoded signs. The following is a conjoined (and highly abstracted) summary of how the typical "MI-work-flow" was implemented by Torresen et al. [@torresen_efficient_2004], Li et al. [@evaluation_study], Eichner et al. [@integrated_speed_limit], and MartinoviÄ‡ et al. [@real_time_detection].

As can be seen in +@fig:MI_Chart, the overall flow consists of seven more or less sequential steps. A more in-depth description of the different tactics for each step will be described at a later point in this report.

#### Picture is Captured

Starting from the left, the first step is to capture a picture. During this step, it has to be predetermined which format to use for the storage of the picture, since this, as previously mentioned in section \ref{DEMOPROG}, affects overall performance.

#### Red Cirle on Screen?

The next step is to determine whether or not a red circle has been detected on the previously captured picture, since this is a pretty good indication of a speed sign being present. If no circle is found the picture is discarded and the process returns to capturing a new picture, as to not waste time on processing a picture without a speed encoded sign.

#### Locate Bounding box Surrounding Circle

If a circle is determined to be in the picture, the next step is to locate, and pass along, where in the picture this circle is to be found. Once coordinates corresponding to a bounding box has been found, the next step commences.

#### Resize and Reduce (to black/white)

Since a picture containing a speed encoded sign might have been captured with various distances between the camera and the sign, the amount of pixels in the picture occupied by the sign may vary as well. The bounding box containing the sign is therefore cropped out of the original picture, stretched or squashed to a predetermined size, as well as converted into a binary black/ white color spectrum.

#### Normalizing

Having a uniform starting point of pixels, the next step is to normalize the picture, before feeding it to a Neural Network (NN). Normalizing in is context is to be seen as conversion into a some sort of data-abstraction the NN can handle.

#### Let Neural Network do its Magic

This part is mostly black magic, high hopes, and potentially Illuminati-unmasking processes, which we will not do any further elaboration as of right now.

#### Return Speed Limit

The final step is to return the determined speed limit to the car-controller, letting it know what speed it should be adjusted to at the given moment. This is immediately followed by a new picture being captured, and the entire process starting over.
