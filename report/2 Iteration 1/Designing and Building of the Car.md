## Designing and Building of the Car
This section describes how the car was designed. Included is a description of the tools used, which features it brings and then steps through the design criteria to assert that the vehicle fulfills the criteria.

### Comparing Design to Design Criteria
This section compares the elements of the design criteria to the design of the vehicle in order to assert that the design complies with the criteria.

#### Weight
The car weighs 1.264 grams with the camera and Raspberry PI mounted, which, as will be mentioned in [@sec:speedCompare], allows the speed of the car to be appropriate, and as such, no further action will be taken towards optimizing the weight of the car.

#### Speed {#sec:speedCompare}
Since the speed requirement was a velocity high enough to accommodate visual distinction between various levels of velocity, a subjective determination is made regarding the fulfillment of the criterion. In [@sec:gearingTest] the results following a test of the gearing is presented, in which it is determined that the top speed of the car will be approximately 6 km/h.  
The group determined that this leaves plenty of room for different distinguishable speed levels.

#### Modular
The car was built with modularity in mind. The camera, EV3, and wheels are easy to remove. Unfortunately, the motors are a bit more difficult to remove, since they sit at the base of the car. This was due to the motors being the centerpiece of the build, as this makes a more rigid car.
