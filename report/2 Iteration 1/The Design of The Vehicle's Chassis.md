# The Design of The Vehicle's Chassis

This section includes a thorough description of how the car was built and the reasoning behind the design. Iterations of the vehicle - if the design of the car was to change during an iteration - will not be included as this was decided to be redundant. 

Most vehicles that are driven on the road are more or less square shaped. Why? In this subsection, it is explored why exactly this design choice is a good way to construct a car's chassis. The design of the car will not change during the rest of this project unless good arguments of why such decision must be made is put forward for discussion. 

### The Shape of the Car

Cars today are typically designed in one of two ways when considered the body and frame: A *unibody* and a *body-on-frame* type of car. The table below lists a few pros and cons on why one is prefered over the other [^unibody_vs_body_on _frame].

| Features          |     | Unibody | Body-on-frame |
| ----------------- | --- | ------- | ------------- |
| Safety (crash)    |     | [x]     | []            |
| Fuel economy      |     | [x]     | []            |
| Weight            |     | [x]     | []            |
| Stress handling   |     | [x]     | []            |
| Off-road strength |     | []      | [x]           |
| Resist twisting   |     | []      | [x]           |

From the table above it can be concluded that the features that the LEGO car needs the most are provided by the unibody. Off-road strength and resisting twisting are features that the LEGO car will never need as it will never experience different terrains other than a standard dry floor. The fuel economy, safety and weight are the primary reasons for the design of the chassis and therefore for the shape of the car.

### The Balance of the Car

The optimal distribution of the weight of the car and its structural integrity are two aspects that were considered when designing the car. The brain and the battery are a unit and weigh .288 kg whereas the two motors combined weigh .162 kg. The difference is .126 kg or a 43.8% in total weight between the brain, battery and the two motors. Therefore, it was decided to make the two motors drive the front wheel to create an equal distribution of weight such that the majority of the weight would not be position in the back or front of the car. If the car would be rear wheel driven car, it could potentially lift the car upon acceleration due to most of the weight being on the rear end.  The decision to make the car front wheel driven also ended up making the LEGO resemble a real life car more.
