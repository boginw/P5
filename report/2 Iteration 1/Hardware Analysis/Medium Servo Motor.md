## EV3 Medium Servo Motor

According to Lego the EV3 Medium Servo Motor is ideal for lower-load and higher speed applications. It introduces faste response times compared to the Ev3 Large Motor and has a smaller profile. It uses tacho feedback whis is a instrument that measures the rotation speed of the motor. This allows for precise control which Lego claims is in one degree of accuracy. [@medium_servo_motor]

### Specifications

- Tachometer to one degree of accuracy
- 240-250 RPM (Rounds per minute)
- Running torque of 8 N.cm
- Stall torque of 12 N.cm
- XXX cm x XXXX cm x XXXX cm
- XXX grams

### Hypothesis

As the EV3 medium motor used in this project is brand new, it is assumed that it will perform better than the specification provided by Lego, this assumtion is based of the presumption that Lego provides conservative numbers for their specifications. It is therefore assumed that the actual measurement for torque is about between 5-10% higher than what the specification states. The same is assumed for the RPMs of the motor.

It is assumed that the specifications given by Lego are based on tests with an external power source and not the included battery. Albeit the power source is expected to equal the output of the included battery at maximum charge. It is therefore presumed that different power levels yield different measurements, including differing torque and RPMs.

The included battery is rated at 7.4V, but the EV3 also takes six standard AA batteries, which are rated at 1.5V, which results in 9V in serial. It is therefore assumed, that given a higher voltage, the measurements of both torque and speed, would be higher than the given specifications.

### Methodology for experiment

Each of the following experiments is to be repeated 3 times to eliminate any abnormalities.

#### Torque

##### Affects of power

#### Speed (RPM)

To test the RPM of the motor, we attach a paper circle, of which one half is colored black, and the other half remains white, which we use to determine half rotations.

The motor is the set to the speed required, and when the motor is up to speed a slow motion camera will record 3 x 10 second samples at 240 fps. Afterwards the samples will be examinated and the number of rotation in each clip will be counted. Then an average rounds per 10 second will be calculated and multiplied for achiving the average rounds per minute.

##### Affects of power

The above method for analyzing the precision of the motor, is to be repeated on both the Ev3 official battery of 7.4V and 6 X 1.5V AA batteries. This is to assert if the increase in voltage has any effect on the precision of the motor.
