## Camera

To start with the PIXY camera [@pixy_camera] was considered to be the camera for the car. This was quickly reconsidered, since this camera was not able to send the actual image to the EV3 computer [giv mig kilde!](http://morten.dk?). Instead LeJOS was to be used as the operating system for the EV3, due to its support for normal webcam cameras.
