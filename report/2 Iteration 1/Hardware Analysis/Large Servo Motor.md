## EV3 Large Servo Motor

The vehicle to be built is required to drive, hence a motor or two are required. The Lego Group provides two types of motors with their Lego Mindstorm set[@mindstorm_set], and to achieve higher speeds with the vehicle, the larger motors, EV3 Large Servo Motor[@large_servo_motor], will be used for drive.

According to Lego the EV3 Large Servo Motor is a powerful motor they which uses tacho feedback (tachometer) which is a instrument that measures the rotation speed of the motor. This allows for precise control which Lego claims is in one degree of accuracy. Lego also claims that motors have some intelligence that allows for aligning motors together, such that they would be able to drive in a straight line at the same speed[@large_servo_motor].

### Specifications
These specifications where fetched from the product page of EV3 Large Servo[@large_servo_motor] and filtered such that only the relevant specifications for the vehicle remain.

- 160-170 RPM (Rounds per minute)
- Running torque of 20 N.cm
- Stall torque of 40 N.cm

### Hypothesis
As the motors provided in the set are brand new, it is assumed that they will perform better than the specification provided by Lego, this assumption is based on the presumption that the specifications provided is created conservatively. It is therefore assumed that the actual measurements for torque and RPM are about between 5-10% higher than what the specification states.

It is assumed that the specifications given by Lego are based on tests with an external power source and not the included battery. Albeit the power source is expected to equal the output of the included battery at maximum charge. As the power-level of the battery 

It is therefore presumed that different power levels yield different measurements, including differing torque and RPMs.

The included battery is rated at 7.4V, but the EV3 also takes six standard AA batteries, which are rated at 1.5V, which results in 9V in serial. It is therefore assumed, that given a higher voltage, the measurements of both torque and speed, would be higher than the given specifications.

### Methodology for experiment

Each of the following experiments is to be repeated 3 times to eliminate any abnormalities.

#### Torque

##### Affects of power

#### Speed (RPM)
To test the RPM of the motor, we attach a paper circle, of which one half is colored black, and the other half remains white, which we use to determine half rotations.

The motor is the set to the speed required, and when the motor is up to speed a slow motion camera will record 3 x 10 second samples at 240 fps. Afterwards the samples will be examinated and the number of rotation in each clip will be counted. Then an average rounds per 10 second will be calculated and multiplied for achiving the average rounds per minute.

##### Affects of power
The above method for analyzing the precision of the motor, is to be repeated on both the Ev3 official battery of 7.4V and 6 X 1.5V AA batteries. This is to assert if the increase in voltage has any effect on the precision of the motor.

#### Precision
In order to test the precision of the motors, a simple angle ruler is used. The motor is to rotate in steps of X degrees. After each step a measurement of the accuracy is taken. 

| X Degrees | Number of steps |
| :-------: | :-------------: |
| 5         | 72              |
| 10        | 36              |
| 25        | 15              |
| 50        | 8               |
| 100       | 8               |
| 175       | 6               |
| 245       | 3               |
| 300       | 2               |
| 360       | 2               |
