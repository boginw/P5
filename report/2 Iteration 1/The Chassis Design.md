# The Design of the Vehicle's Chassis

This section includes a thorough description of how the car was built and the reasoning behind the design. 

Most vehicles that are driven on the road are more or less square shaped. Why? In this subsection, reasoning of why exactly this design choice is a good way to construct the LEGO car's chassis will be explored. The design of the car will not change during the rest of this project unless good arguments of why such a decision must be made is put forward for discussion. 

### The Shape of the Car

Cars today are typically designed in one of two ways when considered the body and frame: A *unibody* and a *body-on-frame* type of car. The table below lists a few pros and cons on why one is prefered over the other [^unibody_vs_body_on _frame].

| Features          |     | Unibody | Body-on-frame |
| ----------------- | --- | ------- | ------------- |
| Safety (crash)    |     | [x]     | []            |
| Fuel economy      |     | [x]     | []            |
| Weight            |     | [x]     | []            |
| Stress handling   |     | [x]     | []            |
| Off-road strength |     | []      | [x]           |
| Resist twisting   |     | []      | [x]           |

From the table above it can be concluded that the features the LEGO car need the most are provided by the unibody. Off-road strength and resisting twisting are features that the LEGO car will never need as it will never experience different terrains other than a standard dry floor. The fuel economy, safety and weight are the primary reasons for the design of the chassis and therefore for the shape of the car.

### The Balance of the Car

The optimal distribution of the weight of the car and its structural integrity are two aspects that were considered when designing the car. The battery weighs .288 kg whereas the two motors combined weigh .162 kg. The difference is .126 kg or a 43.8% in total weight between the brain, battery and the two motors. Therefore, it was decided to position the motors towards the front of the car because the battery is 43.8% larger in total weight compared to the two motors. Positioning the two motors towards the front of the car creates a more equal weight distribution. Also, by making the car front wheel driven, the back of the car will not be able to lift upon initial acceleration. This could potentially have happened if most of the weight were to be positioned in the back and enough speed were outputted. The decision to make the car front wheel driven also ended up making the LEGO resemble a real life car more.

### The Chassis Design
As is depicted on the images in appendix ..., the design that was choosen is of square shape. The reason why is because of the general balance of the car and not actually needing off-road strength, but also because it was the most prefered out of the few prototypes that were drawn before building the actual LEGO car.
