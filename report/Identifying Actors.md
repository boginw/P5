# Identifying Actors

This section concerns the identification and reasoning of actors that are interested in a solution that could reduce the risk of death or any other incapacitated state caused by car accidents.

In articles written by Vejdirektoratet [^vejdirektoratet] and Marketresearch[^marketresearch], two actors were identified.

#### The Danish Government

The Danish Government has been identified as an actor due to its interest in reducing death. Other effects of car accidents are considered high due to social and economic consequences. Car accidents resulting in deaths can be immensely expensive. Police work, ambulance roll-out, cleaning, and other related tasks are all required for each incident. Car accidents resulting in forms of paralysis can be even more expensive. 

The current death rate in Denmark by cars is as low as it has ever been [^vejdirektoratet], but it is still considered high. Therefore, a solution that could potentially reduce the risk of death or becoming incapacitated in such a manner that one is unable to work is desired. That is why autonomous cars could be considered a solution as this feature would perhaps reduce the total amount of decisions made by the individual users. With autonomous cars, laws such as the required minimum distance between cars would be enforced automatically thereby eliminating tailgating. It could also hinder the user exceeding the speed limit for a given range. 

#### The Car Manufacturers

Safety is highly regarded by car manufacturers such as Tesla where extensive testing is done in order to make sure that users of their cars can feel as safe as possible while driving [^tesla_safety_measures]. This is also why Tesla is so diligent about their AutoPilot system, which provides full autonomous driving capabilities. 

Safety is a very important topic for car manufacturers. Any kind of accident that leads to death, especially where families are involved, is most likely, as indicated in an article published by Fortune [^tesla_stock_price_decrease], to decrease the stock price and potentially the total amount of cars sold by the individual car manufacturer. This is one reason why Tesla recommends drivers always stay fully aware and not sleep while the Tesla AutoPilot system is on [^tesla_hands_on].

#### The Users

In many circumstances, the drivers and the passengers of the car are the victims of injury during a car accident. As injury inarguably is an undesirable result, which is why the users are also considered an actor. Given a fully autonomous car, the user focuses on other things whilst in transit. Essentially, this frees the user from spending time on driving.
