# Identifying Actors

This section concerns the identification and reasoning of actors that are interested in a solution that could reduce the risk of death or any other incapacitated state caused by car accidents.

In articles written by Vejdirektoratet [^vejdirektoratet] and Marketresearch[^marketresearch], two actors were identified.

#### The Danish Government

The Danish Government has been identified as an actor due to its interest in reducing death and other effects of car accidents are considered high due to social and economic consequences. Car accidents resulting in deaths can be immensely expensive. Police work, ambulance roll-out, cleaning, and other related tasks are all required for each crash. Car accidents resulting in forms of paralysis can be even more expensive. 

The current death rate in Denmark by cars is as low as it has ever been [^vejdirektoratet], but it is still considered high. Therefore, a solution that could potentially reduce the risk of death or becoming incapacitated in such a manner that one is unable to work is desired. That is why autonomous cars could be considered a solution as this feature would perhaps reduce the total amount of decisions made by the individual users. With autonomous cars, laws such as the required minimum distance between cars would be enforced automatically, thereby eliminating tailgating. In regards to the speed limit, one potential would be that even if the user tried to exceed the speed limit for a given range, it would not be possible. 

#### The Car Manufacturers

Safety is highly regarded by car manufacturers such as Tesla where extensive testing is done in order to make sure that users of their cars can feel as safe as possible while driving [^tesla_safety_measures]. This is also why Tesla is so diligent about their AutoPilot system, which provides full autonomous driving capabilities. 

Safety is a very important topic for car manufacturers. Any kind of accident that leads to death, especially where families are involved, is most likely, as indicated in an article published by Fortune [^tesla_stock_price_decrease], to decrease the stock price and potentially the total amount of cars sold by the individual car manufacturer. This is one reasn why Tesla recommends drivers always stay fully aware and not sleep while the Tesla AutoPilot system is on [^tesla_hands_on].

#### The Users

The user is more of a given because the users are the ones who use the cars and are affected by tragic accidents such as death or any other incapacitated state. As mentioned earlier in regards to car accidents and the correlation between death and an increase of total expenses in Denmark, it is course inexpedient and rather undesirable as the Danish welfare system depends on all tax payers to continue providing healthcare and making other areas in Denmark free to the general public. Given a fully autonomous car, the user focus on other things whilst in transit. Essentially, this free the user from spending time on driving. Another point is that you could be more aware as you meet at work due to not experiencing decision fatique  as you potentially would not have had to make important or demanding decisions while driving.
