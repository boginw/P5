# Identifying Actors

This section concerns the identification and reasoning of actors that are interested in a solution that could reduce the risk of death or any other incapacitated state caused by car accidents.

In articles written by Vejdirektoratet [^vejdirektoratet] and Marketresearch[^marketresearch] two actors were identified.

#### The Danish Government

The Danish Government has been identified as an actor because of the fact that their interest in reducing death and other effects of car accident is considered high due to social and economic consequences. Car accidents resulting in deaths can be immensely expensive. Police work, ambulance roll-out, cleaning, and other related tasks are all required for each crash. Car accidents resulting in forms of paralysis can be even more expensive as. 

The current death rate in Denmark by cars is as low as it has ever been [^vejdirektoratet], but it is still considered high. Therefore, a solution that could potentially reduce the risk of death or becoming incapacitated in such a manner that one is unable to work is desired. That is why autonomous cars could be considered a solution as this feature would perhaps reduce the total amount of decisions made by the individual users. An increase in the likelihood that rules such as the minimum distance from you to the car infront and speed limitis will be complied with. In regards to the speed limit, one potential would be that even if the user tried to exceed the speed limit for a given range, it would not be possible. 

#### The Car Manufacturers

Safety is highly regarded at car manufacturers such as Tesla where extensive testing is done in order to make sure that users of their cars can feel as safe as possible while driving [^tesla_safety_measures]. This is also why Tesla is so diligent about their AutoPilot system, which provides partial autonomous driving. Partial autonomous driving because of the fact that the user is always recommended to be aware of dangerous environments and circumstances while their auto pilot system is active [^tesla_hands_on]. 

Safety is a very important topic for car manufacturers because any kind of accident that leads to death, especially where families are involved, could eventually lead to a bad reputation and inevitably a decrease in the number of cars sold by the individual car manufacturers. Because of this, Tesla recommends drivers keep fully aware during their auto-pilot system is on, albeit not strictly necessary.

However, even though safety is an important aspect of a car another one is how the future market will evolve. The inidivual car manufacturers could seem more attractive for certain companies like those providing ride-sharing as a service. If we are moving toward a future where autonomous cars will become more and more normal, then creating solutions and implementing them in various cars will also become more attractive.

#### The Users

The user is more of a given because the users are the ones who use the cars and are affected by tragic accidents such as death or any other incapacitated state. As mentioned earlier, an increase in the death rate would lead to a decrease in the total amount of money the Danish government would get through taxes. This is of course inexpedient and not very undesirable as the Danish welfare system depends on all tax payers to continue making healthcare and other areas in Denmark free to the general public. However, the ability to let your car navigate autonomously would also mean that, as an individual, you could potentially get more time to rest if you decide to sleep during the distance from your home to work or any other location that gives more than 20 minutes of sleep time. Another fact is that you could be more aware as you meet at work due to not experiencing decision fatique  as you potentially would not have had to make important or demanding decisions while driving.
