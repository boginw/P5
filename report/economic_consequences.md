As seen in the table the cost of injuries registered by the police typically are around 5 times more expensive.  
The reason behind this is that the police is only dispatched if it is a severe incident, where the involved parts usually get lasting injuries that will hinder their ability to work and function in normal everyday activities, requiring support both financially and with everyday chores.  
This is also why both the municipalities and the state shares the biggest load for each incident: they are the ones who are responsible for the transfer payments to support the victims.

In the October 2013 report from The Danish Road Directorate by COWI[^VD_Offentlige_udgifter], the total average cost of an incident (including treatment and social support) was 41.620 DKK, of which the state paid 18.530 DKK, and the municipalities paid 23.090 DKK. This means the state pays 45 % while the municipalities pay 55 %.
The longer a victim of an incident is affected by the injuries, the costlier it will be for the municipality, as there is a gradual shift from the state paying 100 % of the sickness benefits in the first 4 weeks, to the municipality paying 100 % of the sickness benefits after 52 weeks.

The following will be a case study of an accident where the driver becomes paralyzed from the neck and down.[^ST_case_om_ulykke]
Although the source considers another accident, the consequences and following process of said incident is identical.
A young driver named Nikolaj and his friend becomes involved in an accident. His friend is unharmed, but Nikolaj gets a twist in his back and an accumulation of fluid in his spinal cord following the accident.  
Within the first hour of the accident, society has the first expenses: 

| Expense | Cost     |
| ---- | --------:|
| Rescue and transport to the nearest hospital | 3.500 DKK|
 
These expenses does not take materialistic damage into account, as this is usually paid for by private insurance companies. Loss of earnings are likewise not calculated, as this is a complicated calculation that is dependent on a lot of variables, as there will be more people in a line on a freeway than a highway, and more people in the morning than at noon or at night. Furthermore it will be impossible to track how big the expenses actually are, as some people will have others who are not able to start without them in a meeting, and others will just be able to work extra time to compensate for the loss.

Nikolaj is hospitalized for three weeks, and then moved to a rehabilitation center. He spends 11 months at this place, apart from 14 days where he is yet again hospitalized for various studies and a surgery operation.  
This treatment accumulates different expenses:

| Expense                                        | Cost          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------: |
| Foot therapy                                   | 5.000 DKK     |
| Rehabilitation on a physiological hospital     | 1.250.000 DKK |
| Physiotherapy                                  | 85.000 DKK    |
| Hospitalization and various ambulatory studies | 255.000 DKK   |

After the rehabilitation Nikolaj gets moved to a nursing home for the elderly, where he spent the next nine months, until he moved into a home with a care help around the clock. The home was refurbished to accomodate the needs of Nikolaj who is a wheelchair user. Nikolaj has to go to physiotherapy and receives social services for early retirement for the rest of his life.
So the cost of living in the apartment in the first 3 years and 3 months distributes as so:


| Expense                          | Cost          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------: |
| Stay at the nursing home         | 775.000 DKK   |
| Pocket money at the nursing home | 30.000 DKK    |
| Early retirement                 | 1.285.000 DKK |
| Housing benefit                  | 5.000 DKK     |
| Around the clock care            | 6.640.000 DKK |
| Various aids                     | 830.000 DKK   |
| Medicin                          | 10.000 DKK    |
| Sickness benefits                | 95.000 DKK    |
| Refurbishment of apartment       | 60.000 DKK    |

In total, after 5 years, Nikolajs accident cost the society a total of 11.398.500 DKK. For the rest of Nikolajs life the state will have a yearly expense of 2.200.000 DKK to pay for Nikolajs living and care.
