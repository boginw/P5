# Is speed really a concern?
When it comes to traffic safety there is a lot of factors that affects every single accident. In 2017 1.756 people were seriously injured in a road accident, and 175 people lost their life in Denmark.[^VD_Trafikulykker_for_året_2017]  
In Denmark the government funded institution The Danish Road Traffic Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is responsible for analyzing the different accidents involving severe injury or death.

Due to the AIB being the sole provider of these reports in Denmark, they provide the reports that create the foundation for this project.

In a report from December 2014[^HVU_hvorfor_sker_ulykker] the AIB investigates the factors contributing to the cause and the severity of the accidents.  
In this report the AIB assesses how often high speed, amongst other factors, had a significant involvement in the accident happening, as well as how often high speed actually worsened the injuries sustained.  
On page 16 it was found that out of 291 accidents, high speed was involved in 123 of them, being more than 2 out of 5 accidents. Furthermore it was found that in 30 of the 291 accidents (about 1 in 10 accidents) the high speed actually worsened the injuries sustained in the accident.

Looking at the broad numbers is not enough, as the AIB on page 18 recognizes the difference between exceeding the signed speed limit (being risk-willing) and driving faster than the conditions allow, possibly due to bad weather (being risk-blind).

Exceeding the speed limit is the predominant factor in the case of young drivers involved in solo accidents and for motorcyclists. For young drivers in solo accidents the number is about 65%, and for motorcyclists it is above 40%.

In a 2018 report by the AIB[^HVU_Risikovillig_kørsel] they deeply investigate 27 different road accidents where the driver showed risk-willing behavior.  
On page 15 they conclude that of these accidents half of them happened on a straight road, where the driver was exceeding the speed limit by 30 to 150 % when another driver misjudges the distance and the speed of the other vehicle and drives onto the road in front of the risk-willing driver.  
On a road with a limit of 50 km/h there was an average speed of 90 km/h while there on a road with a limit of 80 km/h was an average speed of 138 km/h.
The driver coming onto the road would need to look further than they normally do when orienting themselves, and would have a harder time spotting the other driver, as the car would be further away.  
The increased speed means the risk-willing driver has less time to recognize and react to the situation. This is coupled with a longer breaking distance, which results in the accident.

Another report by AIB from 2011[^HVU_Grove_Hastighedsovertrædelser] investigates the reason why people decides to drive too fast. 99 drivers who exceeded the speed limit was interviewed, and out of these, 44 of the drivers mentions being busy as the reason for exceeding the speed limit.  
32 drivers mentions inattention as the reason why they drove to fast. Of these 32 drivers only 8 of them was not aware that they actually exceeded the speed limit. The remaining 26 drivers was aware that they exceeded the speed limit, but not by how much.
