	abstract = {Engineers looking for an accessible approach to calculus will appreciate Young’s introduction. The book offers a clear writing style that helps reduce any math anxiety they may have while developing their problem-solving skills. It incorporates Parallel Words and Math boxes that provide detailed annotations which follow a multi-modal approach. Your Turn exercises reinforce concepts by allowing them to see the connection between the exercises and examples. A five-step problem solving method is also used to help engineers gain a stronger understanding of word problems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new efficient method for fitting ellipses to scattered data. Previous algorithms either fitted general conics or were computationally expensive. By minimizing the algebraic distance subject to the constraint 4ac-b/sup 2/=1 the new method incorporates the ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The new method combines several advantages: 1) it is ellipse-specific so that even bad data will always return an ellipse; 2) it can be solved naturally by a generalized eigensystem, and 3) it is extremely robust, efficient and easy to implement. We compare the proposed method to other approaches and show its robustness on several examples in which other nonellipse-specific approaches would fail or require computationally expensive iterative refinements.},

  ABSTRACT =      {We present a real-time on-line handwritten character recognition sys-
tem, based on an ensemble of neural networks. In this work we focus on the de-
veloped preprocessing algorithms which help achieve high accuracy rate without a
visible delay in recognition process.
