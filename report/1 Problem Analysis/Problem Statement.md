# Problem Statement

From an investigation conducted by the AIB 291 accidents were analysed. AIB found that in a bit over 40% af these accidents high speed was involved and in 30 of these cases high speed worsened the accident.

In this report the consequense of speeding has been investigated, we foud that speeding caused the injuries of accidents to becomer more severe for the affected, but further more it is expensive for the socity, espeacially in the long term the cost of care and transfer payments can end up in millions.

We found that bot the state, car manufactures, and of cource the implicated of a accident  has an interest in solving/relaxing this problem. It is expensive for the state, hence reducing the severity and number of appearences would be in the interst of the state; Car manufacutres wants their cars to be safer; And people inarguable want to not get hurt when they travel. 

Some car manufactures are already taking some measures to help drivers. Some tools notifies the driver if he or she is going too fast, and others regulate the speed acording to the signs

From this the following problem statement has been formulated:

> How can AI be used to reguale traffic speed in order to reduce the amount of accidents caused by speeding
