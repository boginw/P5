## Problem Statement

By investigating data from The Danish Road Directive it was found that there was a clear correlation between speed and severity in traffic accidents, and, as previously presented, several car manufacturers are currently working on a variety of different technologies used for assisting drivers in driving more safely.
Thereby it has been established that providing a solution to a problem within this field would be a relevant activity. *[Last sentence. Halp! Does not sound professionalsissimistically. Yes. Haelp?]*

The expectations of this project will not be to implement a fully interfaced system in an actual car, but rather to make a small-scale demo of some sorts.
Seeing as this semester is about embedded systems, implementing some sort of autonomy in a small remote-controlled car would be relevant as well.

Following this initial problem analysis, we arrived at the following problem statement:

> __*How would an adaptive-cruise-control-demo be implemented/designed as an embedded intelligent system?*__

As a solution to this problem, the expectation is to present a demonstrational prototype capable of the following:

* Being able to drive with a manually adjusted speed.
* Being able to intelligently detect speed signs, via a second MI-focused system.
* Respond to the MI-system, and adjust the speed accordingly.
