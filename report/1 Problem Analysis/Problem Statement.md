## Problem Statement

By investigating data from The Danish Road Directive it was found that there was a clear correlation between speed and severity in traffic accidents, and, as previously presented, several car manufacturers are currently working on a variety of different technologies used for assisting drivers in driving more safely.
Thereby it has been established that providing a solution to a problem within this field would be a relevant activity. *[Last sentence. Halp! Does not sound professionallissimistically. Yes. Haelp?]*

The expectations of this project will not be to implement a fully interfaced system in an actual car, but rather to make a small-scale demo of some sorts.
Seeing as this semester is about embedded systems, implementing some sort of autonomy in a small remote-controlled car would be relevant as well.

Following this initial problem analysis, we arrived at the following problem statement:

> __*How can a car-system be designed to recognize speed limits, based on visual inputs, such that the car-system never exceeds the speed limit?*__

To determine the success of the project the following sub-problems, and requirements, have been defined:

* A car must be designed and built out of LEGO.
    - The design of the car must uphold criteria specified by the group.
    - The car must be capable of driving on a straight track.
    - The car must be capable of receiving, and reacting to, external commands through a wired or wireless connection. 
* A system capable of recognizing speed signs must be designed and implemented.
    - The system must use commonly uptainable video-capturing hardware.
    - The system must be able to distinguish between different speed signs with a certaincy higher than random.
    - The system must be able to send commands through a wired or wireless connection.
