# Social Consequences

Dealing with accidents and in paticular accidents in traffic, there is a social perspective to consider. It is almost imposible to imagine a accident of any kind that wouldn't have any effect on a human being or society. So what are the social consequences of increased speed in traffik ?

According to The Council For Safe Traffic, a danish origination who describes them self with "Our goal is fewer deaths and injured in traffic. We want everyone to go out safe - and certainly come home again."[^1], there has been 472 deaths, in Denmark between the years 2011 and 2015, in traffic accidents where too high speed was a factor. In this statistic high speed is defined as too high either in accordance to the speed limit or the condition of the road. These numbers excludes the thounsands of people who will have to their lives with permanent injuries caused by traffic accidents.[^2]

To better understand how how speed affect traffic accidents, the Council For Safe Traffic composed some statistics by data from The Norwegian Public Roads Administration. These statistics shows a corralation between speed and fatalities in accidents.[^3]

| Speed | Frontal collision | Pedestrian crossing |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 80 km/h | In 3 out of 10 accidents someone dies | In 6 out of 10 accidents a pedestrian dies. |
| 90 km/h | In 6 out of 10 accidents someone dies | In 8 out of 10 accidents a pedestrian dies. |
| 100 km/h | In 8 out of 10 accidents someone dies | In 9 out of 10 accidents a pedestrian dies. |


Likewise a report from The Danish Road Directorate shows that in 2010 52% of the cases where the driver drove more than 20 km/h too fast resulted in a fatal accident, and only 6% escaped without any injuries. In cases where the driver complies with the speed limit 31% of accidents were fatal, and 37% were completly unharmed. Furtermore the numbers reveal that the speeding limit was exceeded in 59% of all fatal accidents. The report also shows how speed directly has been the cause of a fatal accident. The table bellow shows how diffrent levels of increased speed effects the number of fatal accidents.[^4]


| Number of death-accidents | Accident Factor | Injury Factor | Not coursed by speeding | Total |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Under or upto speed-limit     | 14 (19%)     | 8     | 52     | 74     |
| 1-10 km/h above speed-limit     | 10 (37%)     | 8     | 9     | 27     |
| 11-20 km/h above speed-limit     | 12 (52%)     | 4     | 7     | 23     |
| 21-40 km/h above speed-limit     | 29 (97%)     | 3     | 1     | 30     |
| 41- km/h above speed-limit     | 25 (100%)     | 1     | 0     | 25     |
| Total | 90 | 24 | 69 | 179 |


Thus a tendency is shown, speed has a significant influence on fatal accidents in the traffic. According to The Council For Safe Traffic between 2011 and 2015 472 died in traffic due to increased speed, in 70% speed was a contributory factor, and in the remaing 30% it was the main reason to accident resulting fatal.[^3]
These numbers shows that around 118 fatal accidents yearly, could potentially have been avoided if the speed limit was respected.
