# Overview of the project
Every essential part of the system is introduced at this point, this chapter will show how the different parts operate together in the system. The system itself is divided into two components, the car system and the Speed Sign Recognition system (SSR system), this chapter will resemble that by explaining those components individually and end of explaining the communication between them.

## The car system
The car is a relatively simple system. It consists of three sub-components which each has their own specific responsibility.  Firstly there is a component which responsibility is to handle the communication with the SSR system and other internal components depending on that communication. The internal communication is handled by an observer pattern, meaning that the components depending on the messages from the SSR system are added as observers to the communication component. In this project the wording `observer` are not used, instead of the word `listener` is used, therefore `observer` and `listener` will be used interchangeably. How the communication component work will be explained in @[ref:subsec:communication], the rest of this section will focus on the listeners.

### Motor control component
The motor control component has, as the name implies the responsibility for controlling the motors. By controlling the motors means controlling the amount of power given to the motors. Since the leJOS operating system supplies all necessary boilerplate code to interact with the EV3 brick and the EV3 Motors, the speed is set as degrees per second. The maximum sustainable speed is 100 x the battery voltage. This means that depending on the battery voltage the car might not be able to reach its maximum speed. Because of that, the group decided to make the recognized speeds relative to the maximum available given the remaining voltage on the battery. This is possible due to the fact that leJOS supply an interface to get that amount of degrees per second. So taking a naive approach an consider the cars possible max speed as equal to the maximum allowed speed.
