## Usage

To include another file, the following command can be used:

> !{{relative_path_to_file}}

**NOTE:** this command must be the only content on the line, otherwise it will be ignored.

## Style

The following describes how to keep the agreed style of formatting.

### Titles and Headlines

In this report The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) will be used as style for headlines and titles. The rules are as follow:
1. Capitalize the first and last words in titles and subtitles (but see rule 7), and capitalize all other major words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctionsâ€”but see rule 4).
2. Lowercase the articles *the*, *a*, and *an*.
3. Lowercase prepositions, regardless of length, except when they are used adverbially or adjectivally (*up* in *Look Up*, *down* in *Turn Down*, *on* in *The On Button*, *to* in *Come To*, etc.) or when they compose part of a Latin expression used adjectivally or adverbially (*De Facto*, *In Vitro*, etc.).
4. Lowercase the common coordinating conjunctions *and*, *but*, *for*, *or*, and *nor*.
5. Lowercase *to* not only as a preposition (rule 3) but also as part of an infinitive (*to Run*, *to Hide*, etc.), and lowercase as in any grammatical function.
6. Lowercase the part of a proper name that would be lowercased in text, such as *de* or *von*.
7. Lowercase the second part of a species name, such as *fulvescens* in *Acipenser fulvescens*, even if it is the last word in a title or subtitle.

The list has been yanked from the [CMOS-homepage](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch08/psec159.html).

## Install & Compile

Although you will not need to install anything (except a Markdown editor) as the[CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Lynhx/P5) will generate artifacts, including a compiled PDF, this can be helpful for taking a glimpse of what the final result might look like.

### Install
To install you'll need some prerequisites (_these packages are fairly large_).

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base -y
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended -y
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra -y
sudo apt-get install pandoc -y
```

### Compile

To compile, just execute the following command:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

If no errors occurred, you should see a folder `dist` in the root of the project, containing the resulting PDF `output.pdf`.

## Example

Bellow are included files, when compiled you should see complete lyrics
